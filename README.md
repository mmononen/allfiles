# allfiles.py

### How the program works
* For all zip-files in the directory
  * See if they contain 'file_id.diz' file
    * Gather the diz-files together
* Write the gathered results in one contents text file

### Things to consider before using this
**At the moment this is really just a quick hack to get the specific work done.**
* Might not work with all zip-files
* Does not handle uppercase filenames
* Does not know how to handle folders in zip-files
* Does not recognize any other archive format besides zip
